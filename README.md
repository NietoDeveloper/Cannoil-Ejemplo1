Built With
List the major frameworks, libraries, and technologies used in your project.

Frontend:

React.js

Tailwind CSS

React Router (if applicable)

Axios (if applicable for API calls)

Redux Toolkit (if applicable for state management)

Other specific React libraries...

Backend:

Node.js

Express.js (if using an Express server)

Mongoose (if using MongoDB)

bcrypt.js (for password hashing, if applicable)

jsonwebtoken (for authentication, if applicable)

Other specific Node.js libraries...

Development Tools:

Vite / Create React App (your React build tool)

ESLint

Prettier

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name
Install Frontend Dependencies:

Navigate into the client (or frontend, or your chosen frontend directory name) and install dependencies:

Bash

cd client # or your frontend directory name
npm install # or yarn install
Install Backend Dependencies:

Navigate into the server (or backend, or your chosen backend directory name) and install dependencies:

Bash

cd ../server # Go back to the root, then into server
npm install # or yarn install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create .env files in both your frontend and backend directories and populate them as described in the Environment Variables section.

Usage
Describe how to use your application. Provide examples of typical workflows.

Start the Backend Server:

From the server directory:

Bash

npm run dev # or npm start, or your backend start script
The backend server will typically run on http://localhost:5000 (or whatever port you've configured).

Start the Frontend Development Server:

From the client directory:

Bash

npm run dev # or npm start, or your frontend start script
The frontend application will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port your build tool uses).

Interact with the Application:

Explain the main ways users will interact with your application. For example:

"Navigate to the registration page to create an account."

"Use the search bar to find products."

"Click on items to add them to your cart."

Scripts
List and explain the most important npm or yarn scripts in both your frontend and backend package.json files.

Frontend (client/package.json)
npm run dev / yarn dev: Starts the development server.

npm run build / yarn build: Builds the application for production.

npm run lint / yarn lint: Runs ESLint checks.

npm run format / yarn format: Formats code with Prettier.

Backend (server/package.json)
npm run dev / yarn dev: Starts the server in development mode (e.g., with nodemon).

npm start / yarn start: Starts the server in production mode.

npm test / yarn test: Runs backend tests.

Environment Variables
This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information and configuration.

Create a .env file in both the client and server directories based on the .env.example files provided.

Frontend (client/.env)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# Add any other client-side environment variables here
Backend (server/.env)
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname # Or your remote DB URI
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_SECRET_KEY
# Add any other server-side environment variables here (e.g., API keys)
Important: Never commit your actual .env files to version control. They are ignored by .gitignore.

Testing
Describe how to run tests for your application.

Frontend Testing
If you have frontend tests (e.g., with React Testing Library, Jest):

Bash

cd client
npm test # or yarn test
Backend Testing
If you have backend tests (e.g., with Jest, Supertest, Mocha, Chai):

Bash

cd server
npm test # or yarn test
